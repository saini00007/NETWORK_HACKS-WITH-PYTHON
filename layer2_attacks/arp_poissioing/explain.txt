This Python script is designed to perform an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning attack. ARP poisoning involves manipulating ARP tables on a 
local area network (LAN) to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host, redirecting traffic intended for that host to the 
attacker's machine.

Let's break down how the script accomplishes this:

1. **Command-line Argument Handling (Lines 7-9):** 
   - It checks if the user provided the required command-line argument, which is the network interface (`iface`) to use for sniffing and sending packets.
   - If the argument is missing, it prints the correct usage of the script and exits.

2. **ARP Poisoning Callback Function (Lines 11-24):** 
   - The `arp_poison_callback` function is defined to handle packets sniffed by Scapy.
   - When Scapy detects an ARP packet, it triggers this callback function.
   - Inside the function:
     - It checks if the received packet is an ARP request (ARP operation code `1`).
     - If it is, it constructs a spoofed ARP response packet (`answer`) claiming to be the target machine.
     - The script then prints a message indicating the ARP spoofing activity.
     - Finally, it sends the spoofed ARP response packet using Scapy's `sendp` function.

3. **Packet Sniffing (Lines 26-29):**
   - The script initiates packet sniffing using Scapy's `sniff` function.
   - It specifies:
     - The callback function to execute for each packet (`arp_poison_callback`).
     - A filter to apply, in this case, only ARP packets (`"arp"`).
     - The network interface to sniff on, obtained from the command-line arguments.
     - `store=0` to prevent storing sniffed packets in memory.

Overall, the script listens for ARP requests on the specified network interface and responds to them with spoofed ARP responses, tricking the sender 
into associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host on the network. This enables the attacker to intercept and potentially 
manipulate network traffic between the target host and other devices on the network.

=>it will give output as:
Fooling 192.168.4.1 that 192.168.4.19 is me
.
Sent 1 packets.
Fooling 192.168.4.1 that 192.168.4.19 is me
.
Sent 1 packets.
Fooling 192.168.4.19 that 192.168.4.1 is me
.

=>How to Use:
To use this script, you need to run it from the command line with the interface as an argument. For example:

"python script.py eth0"

Replace eth0 with the appropriate interface name on your system. Once running, the script will sniff ARP packets on the specified interface and perform 
ARP poisoning by replying to ARP requests with spoofed ARP replies.
