This Python script is designed to detect port scans by monitoring incoming TCP packets using Scapy. Let's
break down the functionality of the script:

### 1. Importing Libraries:
```python
import sys
from time import time
from scapy.all import sniff
```
- `sys` is imported to access command-line arguments.
- `time` function from the `time` module is used to get the current time in Unix format.
- `sniff` function from Scapy is used to capture and process incoming packets.

### 2. Global Variables:
```python
ip_to_ports = dict()
nr_of_diff_ports = 10
port_scan_timespan = 10
```
- `ip_to_ports`: A dictionary to store IP addresses and the ports they have scanned, along with the time of the scan.
- `nr_of_diff_ports`: Maximum number of different ports scanned within a time span.
- `port_scan_timespan`: Time span (in seconds) within which port scans are monitored.

### 3. Function Definition:
```python
def detect_port_scan(packet):
    ip = packet.getlayer("IP")
    tcp = packet.getlayer("TCP")
    # Records scanned port and time in Unix format
    ip_to_ports.setdefault(ip.src, {})[str(tcp.dport)] = int(time())
    # Checks if source IP has scanned too many different ports
    if len(ip_to_ports[ip.src]) >= nr_of_diff_ports:
        scanned_ports = ip_to_ports[ip.src].items()
        # Checks recorded time of each scan
        for (scanned_port, scan_time) in scanned_ports:
            # Deletes scanned port if not in timeout span
            if scan_time + port_scan_timespan < int(time()):
                del ip_to_ports[ip.src][scanned_port]
        # Deletes source IP if still too many scanned ports
        if len(ip_to_ports[ip.src]) >= nr_of_diff_ports:
            print("Port scan detected from " + ip.src)
            print("Scanned ports: " + ", ".join(ip_to_ports[ip.src].keys()) + "\n")
            del ip_to_ports[ip.src]
```
- `detect_port_scan`: This function is called for each captured packet by Scapy. It extracts the IP and 
TCP layers from the packet.
- It records the scanned port and its scan time in Unix format in the `ip_to_ports` dictionary.
- If the source IP has scanned too many different ports, it checks the recorded time of each scan. If 
any scanned port is not within the timeout span, it deletes it. If the source IP still has too many scanned 
ports after this cleanup, it prints a detection message and removes the source IP from the dictionary.

### 4. Main Sniffing:
```python
if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print(sys.argv[0] + " <iface>")
    sys.exit(0)
sniff(prn=detect_port_scan, filter="tcp", iface=sys.argv[1], store=0)
```
- The script checks if the required command-line argument (the network interface) is provided. If not, 
it prints usage information and exits.
- It starts sniffing packets on the specified network interface (`sys.argv[1]`) using the `sniff` function. 
It calls the `detect_port_scan` function for each captured packet, filters only TCP packets, and disables 
storing packets in memory (`store=0`).

This script monitors incoming TCP packets and detects port scans based on the number of different ports scanned 
by a source IP within a specified time span. If a source IP exceeds the defined threshold, it's considered a 
port scan, and the script prints a detection message along with the scanned ports.
