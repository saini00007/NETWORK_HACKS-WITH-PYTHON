It imports necessary modules:

sys for handling command-line arguments and exiting the script.
send, IP, and ICMP from scapy.all module. These are used for sending packets and constructing IP and ICMP packets.
The script checks if the number of command-line arguments is less than 3 (i.e., if source and destination IP addresses are provided). If not, it prints a usage message and exits with an error code.

It constructs an ICMP packet with the specified source and destination IP addresses provided as command-line arguments. This is done using IP(src=source_ip, dst=destination_ip) / ICMP(). IP() creates an IP header, and ICMP() creates an ICMP echo request packet.

The constructed packet is then sent using the send() function. The response (if any) is stored in the answer variable.

If a response is received, it prints the details of the response packet using the show() method of the response packet.

Overall, this script allows you to send an ICMP echo request packet from a specified source IP address to a destination IP address and displays the response, if any.

To use this script, run it from the command line with the source and destination IP addresses as arguments:


./script.py <source_ip> <destination_ip>

Replace <source_ip> and <destination_ip> with the actual IP addresses you want to use.
