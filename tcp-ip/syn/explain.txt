Source Port Range:


"source_ports = range(1024, 65536)"


We define a range of source ports from 1024 to 65535. These are the ports from which the SYN packets will appear 
to originate. Using a range allows us to send multiple SYN packets with different source ports, which helps in 
evading detection and allows for more effective flooding.
Sending SYN Packets:



"for sport in source_ports:
    packet = IP(src=spoofed_ip, dst=target_ip) / TCP(sport=sport, dport=80, flags="S")
    send(packet, verbose=False)"

We iterate over each source port in the source_ports range. For each port, we construct a TCP SYN packet with the
spoofed source IP address (spoofed_ip), the target IP address (target_ip), and the current source port.
The send() function from Scapy is used to send the constructed packet. Setting verbose=False suppresses the 
output of each packet sent to avoid cluttering the terminal.
Printing Sent Packets:


"print(f"Sent SYN packet from {spoofed_ip}:{sport} to {target_ip}:80")'""''

After sending each SYN packet, we print a message indicating the source IP address and port from which the packet was sent, as well as the target IP address and port.
Completion Message:

python
Copy code
"print("SYN flood complete.")"


Finally, we print a message indicating the completion of the SYN flood once all SYN packets have been sent.
Overall, the script now sends multiple SYN packets with different source ports to a specified target IP address,
effectively flooding the target with connection requests and potentially causing denial-of-service (DoS) conditions 
if the target is unable to handle the volume of incoming connections. It's essential to use such scripts responsibly 
and only on networks for which you have authorization to perform testing.
