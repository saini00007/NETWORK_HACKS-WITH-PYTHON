writer:---.

We define a write_packet function that writes the captured packet to the pcap dump file.
We set the network interface (dev) and the output pcap dump file (dump_file).
We open a live capture using pcapy.open_live.
We open a dump file using pcap.dump_open.
We start a packet capture loop using pcap.loop, where each captured packet is passed to the write_packet function.
Please adjust the dev and dump_file variables according to your requirements before running the code. Additionally, 
ensure that you have the necessary permissions to capture network packets.

 We define a read_packet function that prints the header and data of each packet.
We set the input pcap dump file (input_file).
We open the pcap dump file for reading using pcapy.open_offline.
We start a packet capture loop using pcap.loop, where each packet read from the pcap dump file is passed to the read_packet function.
Please replace the input_file variable with the path to your pcap dump file before running the code. This code will print out information 
about each packet in the pcap dump file.
