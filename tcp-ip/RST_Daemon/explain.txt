This script utilizes the scapy library to sniff and manipulate network packets. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Import Statements:

The script starts by importing necessary modules from scapy. sniff is used for packet sniffing, send for sending packets, and IP and TCP for creating
 IP and TCP packets respectively.
Default Configuration:

It sets default values for the network interface (dev) and packet filter (filter). These can be adjusted as needed.
handle_packet Function:

This function is the callback used by sniff to handle each captured packet.
It checks if the packet is a TCP packet using packet.haslayer(TCP).
Then, it checks if the packet is not a SYN, RST, FIN, and is an ACK packet.
If the conditions are met, it constructs a TCP RST packet with the appropriate fields (source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, 
sequence number, and acknowledgment number) reversed.
It sends the constructed RST packet using send.
Finally, it prints information about the reset connection, including source and destination IP addresses and ports.
Sniffing Packets:

The sniff function is called with parameters specifying the interface to sniff on (iface=dev), the filter to apply (filter=filter), and the callback function 
to handle each packet (prn=handle_packet).
Note:

The script concludes with a note advising that it should only be used for legitimate testing purposes, likely due to the potential impact of sending RST packets 
on network connections.
Overall, this script allows you to sniff TCP packets on a specified network interface, identify certain types of packets, and send RST packets to reset TCP 
connections for those packets. It's important to use such scripts responsibly and ethically, as they can potentially disrupt network communications.
