Explanation:

The script is a Python program that sends an ICMP Redirect message to redirect traffic from a specified target to a new gateway.
It uses the getopt module to parse command-line options.
Command-line options include -t for the target address, -o for the old gateway address, and -n for the new gateway address.
After parsing the command-line options, the script constructs an ICMP Redirect packet using Scapy.
The ICMP Redirect packet is sent to the target with the specified old gateway address and the new gateway address.
This script could be used for network manipulation or testing scenarios where you want to redirect traffic from one gateway to another. However, 
note that manipulating network traffic without proper authorization may be against network policies or laws. Always use such scripts responsibly and with permission.


defence Method::

ICMP redirection attacks can be easily defended against on a Linux system by deactivating
the accept-redirects kernel option. This can be achieved by the following magic line:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_redirects62

or by editing /etc/systctl.conf and setting

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

BSD- and Mac OS X systems provide similar functionality.
