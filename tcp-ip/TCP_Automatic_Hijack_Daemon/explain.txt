This script seems to hijack TCP connections based on certain criteria such as specific payload, source IP, and port. It manipulates packets using Scapy
 to send crafted packets to reset connections or perform other actions.

Here's a summary of its functionality:

It sets default values for network interface, server port, server IP, client IP, payload to inject, and payload to grep.
Defines a function handle_packet() to handle each captured packet. It checks if the packet is TCP and meets certain conditions for hijacking, then sends 
crafted packets accordingly.

Provides a usage message for command-line options.
Parses command-line options to set variables accordingly.
Constructs a filter for sniffing packets based on command-line options.
Initiates packet sniffing using Scapy's sniff() function with specified parameters.
Please note that using such scripts may have legal and ethical implications, and should only be done in controlled environments with appropriate authorization.

To use the provided script, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
   - Install the necessary libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install scapy
     ```

2. **Understand the Script**:
   - Review the script to understand its functionality and customize it according to your requirements.

3. **Command Line Options**:
   - The script accepts several command-line options:
     - `-c <client_ip>`: Optional. Specifies the client IP address.
     - `-d <data_to_inject>`: Optional. Specifies the data to inject into packets.
     - `-g <payload_to_grep>`: Optional. Specifies the payload to search for in packets.
     - `-i <interface>`: Optional. Specifies the network interface to sniff on. Default is `enp3s0f1`.
     - `-p <srv_port>`: Specifies the server port.
     - `-s <srv_ip>`: Specifies the server IP address.

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Run the script with appropriate command-line options. For example:
     ```
     python script.py -p 80 -s 192.168.1.100
     ```
     This command hijacks all TCP connections to the server IP `192.168.1.100` on port `80`.
   - You can customize the command-line options based on your requirements.

5. **Testing**:
   - After running the script, it will start sniffing packets on the specified interface and port.
   - Based on the defined criteria (client IP, payload, etc.), it will attempt to hijack TCP connections.
   - Monitor the script's output for information about hijacked connections and any injected data.

6. **Caution**:
   - Use this script responsibly and only in controlled environments or with appropriate authorization.
   - Improper use of this script may have legal and ethical implications.

7. **Termination**:
   - Terminate the script by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

Remember, the provided script is for educational and testing purposes only. Misuse of such scripts can cause
 harm and is unethical. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before performing any network-related activities.
