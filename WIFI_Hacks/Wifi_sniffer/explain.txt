Explanation:

The script starts by importing necessary modules (os and scapy).
It sets the iface variable to the network interface "wlp2s0".
It then sets the network interface to monitor mode using the iwconfig command via os.system.
A function dump_packet is defined to print information about packets that are not beacons, probe requests, or probe responses. It uses pkt.haslayer() to check the presence of specific layers in the packet.
The main loop continuously loops over channels 1 through 14, sets the network interface to each channel, and then uses sniff() from Scapy to capture packets on the specified interface. The prn parameter is set to the dump_packet function defined earlier to process each captured packet.
The script keeps running indefinitely, continuously switching between channels and capturing packets.
This script essentially sets a network interface to monitor mode and continuously captures and prints information about non-beacon, non-probe packets on each channel within a loop.
