Explanation:

This script utilizes Scapy library for packet manipulation and sniffing.
It sets up a function handle_packet() to process incoming packets. Specifically, it checks if the packet is a Probe Response (a type of packet in Wi-Fi networks), and if so, it prints the current timestamp, the source MAC address of the device sending the probe response, and the SSID it's searching for.
It then sets the specified network interface (iface) into monitor mode using the iwconfig command.
Finally, it starts sniffing packets on the specified interface using Scapy's sniff() function, with the prn parameter set to call handle_packet() for each packet received.
